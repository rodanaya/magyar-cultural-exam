## Document-by-Document Breakdown

### 1. Mexican Birth Certificate (Acta de Nacimiento)

This is the most complex document to get from abroad.

**Step 1: Get a recent certified copy from Mexico**

Option A — Online (easiest):
- Go to: **https://www.gob.mx/ActaNacimiento**
- You can order a certified digital copy (acta de nacimiento en linea) for ~70 MXN
- It's a legally valid certified copy with a QR verification code (CURP-linked)
- You can download and print it immediately
- This works for birth certificates registered in most Mexican states

Option B — Through the Mexican Embassy in Budapest:
- **Embajada de Mexico en Budapest**
- Address: Roemer Floris u. 58, 1024 Budapest
- Phone: +36 1 326 0447
- They can help you request a certified copy from Mexico's Civil Registry
- Make an appointment (cita) first — walk-ins may not be served
- Bring your passport, CURP, and any old copy of your birth certificate
- Processing time: varies, could be 2-6 weeks

Option C — Have family in Mexico get it:
- A family member goes to the **Registro Civil** (Civil Registry Office) in the municipality where you were born
- They request a "copia certificada del acta de nacimiento"
- Cost: varies by state, usually 100-300 MXN
- They mail or courier it to you in Hungary (DHL/FedEx recommended, 3-5 business days)

**Step 2: Apostille it in Mexico**

Hungary and Mexico are both parties to the **Hague Apostille Convention**, so you need an apostille (NOT embassy legalization).

- The apostille must be issued by the **SRE** (Secretaria de Relaciones Exteriores / Ministry of Foreign Affairs)
- Can be done online: **https://www.gob.mx/sre** → "Apostilla de documentos"
- Or in person at any SRE delegation office **in Mexico**
- Cost: approximately 730 MXN (changes periodically)
- **WARNING:** The Mexican Embassy in Budapest most likely CANNOT issue apostilles. Apostilles are typically only issued by the SRE inside Mexico. Call the embassy (+36 1 326 0447) to confirm, but plan for having this done in Mexico.
- If family is helping, they can do this step in Mexico before mailing it
- The apostille is attached/stamped to the back of the birth certificate
- **Important:** The apostille must be on the SAME certified copy you'll use — get the apostille AFTER getting the fresh certified copy
- **Practical tip:** Have family in Mexico get the certified copy AND apostille it in one trip, then courier both to you

**Step 3: Get a certified Hungarian translation (hiteles forditas)**

- In Hungary, only **OFFI** (Orszagos Forditó es Forditashitelesito Iroda / Hungarian Office for Translation and Attestation) translations are accepted by government offices
- OFFI website: **https://www.offi.hu**
- Address: 1062 Budapest, Bajza u. 52.
- Bring the apostilled original — they translate from Spanish
- Cost: approximately 10,000-15,000 HUF per page
- Processing time: standard ~5 business days, express available for extra fee
- You get back your original + a certified Hungarian translation stapled/bound to it

**Summary of birth certificate flow:**
```
Get certified copy (Mexico/online/embassy)
    → Apostille it (SRE Mexico)
        → Translate it (OFFI Budapest)
            → Ready to submit
```

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Using non-OFFI translations.** Only OFFI translations are accepted by Hungarian government offices. Don't use freelance translators.
2. **Expired criminal record.** It has a shelf life (usually 3-6 months). Get it last, not first.
3. **Missing apostille.** An un-apostilled Mexican document will be rejected. The apostille must be on the same physical document.
4. **Old birth certificate.** Some offices want a "recent" certified copy (within 3-6 months). Get a fresh one even if you have an old copy.
5. **Landlord forgot to sign.** The befogadó nyilatkozat (accommodation consent) must be signed and often notarized. Coordinate with your landlord in advance.
6. **Not enough copies.** Bring originals AND photocopies of everything. The office keeps copies and returns originals.
